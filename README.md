# JS213_FinalProject

This is my final project for JS213.

I built the front end and back end using as much JS as possible. 

On the main page, clicking an animal image will bring up some text and a photograph corresponding to the selected animal.

You can "pet" the animal to see an animation and captions pop over the image.

You can also click to see additional photographs of the selected info.

I left a lot of comments/questions in script.js. 

The art and photos are mine.
